The original purpose of this repository is to hold a Lean4 formalization of [the proof of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (PFR) conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05762) of Katalin Marton (see also [this blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2023/11/13/on-a-conjecture-of-marton)).  The statement is as follows: if $A$ is a non-empty subset of ${\bf F}_2^n$ such that $\vert A+A\vert \leq K\vert A\vert$, then $A$ can be covered by at most $2K^{12}$ cosets of a subspace $H$ of ${\bf F}_2^n$ of cardinality at most $\vert A\vert$.  The proof relies on the theory of Shannon entropy, so in particular development of the Shannon entropy inequalities was needed.

After the primary purpose of the project was completed, a second stage of the project developed several consequences of PFR, as well as an argument of Jyun-Jie Liao that reduced the exponent $12$ to $11$.  This second stage has also been completed.

Currently, the project is obtaining an extension of PFR to other bounded torsion groups, as well as formalizing a further refinement of Jyun-Jie Liao that improves the exponent further to $9$.

## Build the Lean files

To build the Lean files of this project, you need to have a working version of Lean.
See [the installation instructions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) (under Regular install).

To build the project, run `lake exe cache get` and then `lake build`.

## Build the blueprint

See instructions at <https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint/>.

## Moving material to mathlib

As the first two phases of the project are completed, we are currently working towards stabilising the new results and contributing them to mathlib.
